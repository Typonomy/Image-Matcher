# Image-Matcher
This finds duplicated images in specified folders.  This is useful to clean up after putting two hard drives together or getting images off your phone.

First, make a new empty folder and a csv that's not in it.  They can be anywhere you want.  The program will sort duplicate images into this folder, then print the full list of matched filenames into the CSV.  This way you can review it, make sure one copy was retained, and rename the preserved files better etc.

I'm going to make it create the folder and CSV automatically in an update, I'm just learning how to use repositories here.
